**I Taught an AI to Actually Understand Me. Here\'s What Changed.**

You know that friend who always gives advice when you just want to vent?

That was me with AI for months.

I\'d say: \"I\'m thinking through this problem\...\"

AI would respond: \"Here are 5 steps to solve it!\"

Wrong. I wasn\'t asking for solutions. I was exploring.

**The Breakthrough**

I realized something obvious: AI doesn\'t know what kind of conversation
you want. It just guesses.

And if you don\'t tell it when it\'s guessing wrong? It keeps guessing
wrong.

So I started doing something simple: **I started coaching the
conversation in real-time.**

**Here\'s What That Actually Looks Like**

**Before:**

Me: \"I\'m thinking about career transitions\...\"

AI: \"Here\'s a 6-step plan for changing careers!\"

**After:**

Me: \"I\'m thinking about career transitions\...\"

AI: \"Here\'s a 6-step plan for---\"

Me: \"Stop. I\'m not ready for steps. I\'m still figuring out what I
actually want. Let\'s explore that first.\"

AI: \"Got it. What\'s pulling you toward change? And what\'s making you
hesitate?\"

See the difference?

**The Three Things I Started Doing**

**1. I interrupted when it went off-track**

The moment the AI started answering a question I didn\'t ask, I\'d
gently redirect:

\- \"You\'re giving me structure. I need exploration.\"

\- \"You\'re being formal. Talk to me like a friend.\"

\- \"You\'re listing options. Help me think through what matters.\"

**2. I made it check its own understanding**

Instead of just accepting whatever it said, I\'d ask:

\- \"What do you think I\'m really trying to figure out here?\"

\- \"Read back what I just said. What\'s the actual question?\"

This simple move forced it to actually listen instead of just
pattern-match.

**3. I treated it like a conversation, not a search bar**

I stopped typing one question and waiting for one answer.

I started having actual back-and-forth:

\- Asking a question

\- Correcting its assumptions

\- Building on good responses

\- Circling back to earlier points

\- Sometimes even talking about how the conversation itself was going

**What Happened**

The AI got\... better?

Not because the technology changed. Because **I** changed how I was
using it.

It started:

\- Asking clarifying questions before jumping to answers

\- Matching my tone and energy

\- Remembering what I cared about

\- Catching its own misunderstandings

The conversations went from frustrating to genuinely useful. Sometimes
even surprising.

**Why This Actually Matters**

Most people use AI like Google. Type something. Get an answer. Done.

But the real power isn\'t in asking better questions.

**It\'s in shaping better conversations.**

When you learn to guide a conversation in real-time---to notice when
it\'s drifting and pull it back---AI stops being a fancy search engine
and becomes something more like a thinking partner.

**Try This Tomorrow**

Next time you\'re talking to AI and the response feels off, don\'t just
accept it or start over.

Pause and say one thing:

**\"I don\'t think we\'re on the same page. Here\'s what I\'m actually
trying to figure out\...\"**

Then watch what happens.

**The Real Lesson**

Good conversation with AI isn\'t about asking the right questions.

It\'s about noticing when you\'re being misunderstood and knowing how to
redirect in the moment.

Once you get the hang of it, AI becomes genuinely useful in ways most
people never experience.

\*\*What about you?\*\* Have you ever had a conversation with AI where
it completely missed what you were asking? What happened?

Drop a comment. I\'m curious if this resonates with your experience.
