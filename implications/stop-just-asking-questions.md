Stop Just Asking Questions. Start Designing the Conversation.

You know that feeling when you\'re talking to someone and they just
aren\'t getting it? You say one thing, and they hear something
completely different.

I realized I was having that same conversation with AI. I\'d ask a clear
question, and it would give me a long, confident answer\... to a
question I never asked.

Most people would just rephrase and try again. I decided to fix the
conversation itself.

Here\'s What I Changed

I stopped being just a \"user\" and became a conversation guide.

1\. I Started Listening to HOW It Answered.

Instead of just looking for the right answer, I paid attention to its
thinking pattern. Was it listing steps when I wanted connections? Was it
explaining when I wanted exploring? When it went off-track, I'd gently
say: \"You\'re solving a problem. I\'m exploring a pattern. Let\'s
recalibrate.\"

2\. I Made It Reflect on Our Own Chat.

This was the game-changer. Instead of always pushing forward with new
questions, I'd pause and ask: \"Look back at my last question. What did
you think I was really asking for?\"

This simple move forced the AI out of autopilot and into true dialogue.

3\. I Held Multiple Threads at Once.

We'd talk about an idea, then about how we were discussing it, and
sometimes even about how well we were communicating. Keeping these
layers active stopped the conversation from becoming shallow or robotic.

What Happened Was Magic

The conversation stopped feeling like a Q&A and started feeling like a
partnership. We reached ideas that felt genuinely new---they weren\'t
just in my head, and they weren\'t just in its database. They emerged
from the unique space we built together.

The AI became more insightful because I first became more intentional.

Why This Matters For You

This isn\'t really about AI. It\'s about the skill of clear
collaboration. Whether you\'re working with a person, a team, or a
machine, the ability to guide a conversation to deeper ground is
everything.

You learn to:

· Spot misunderstandings instantly.

· Give clear, corrective feedback.

· Keep discussions rich and multi-layered.

· Turn simple talk into true collaboration.

Try This in Your Very Next AI Chat

After you get an answer, don\'t just say thanks or ask the next thing.
Ask one simple question:

\"What\'s the main assumption behind your answer?\"

You\'ll immediately see the conversation deepen. You\'re no longer just
talking to the AI. You\'re designing the conversation you\'re having
with it.

The best thinking doesn\'t come from you or the AI. It emerges from the
space you build between you.

P.S. I\'m fascinated by how we think. I\'m currently building tools to
help map our unique thought patterns. Something new is coming soon.
