**I Fixed AI\'s Worst Habit With One Sentence. It Exposed Why Your AI
Governance is Failing.**

You know that friend who always gives advice when you just want to vent?

That was me with AI for months.

I\'d say: \"I\'m thinking through this problem\...\"

AI would respond: \"Here are 5 steps to solve it!\"

Wrong. I wasn\'t asking for solutions. I was exploring.

**The Breakthrough**

I realized something obvious: AI doesn\'t know what kind of conversation
you want. It just guesses.

And if you don\'t tell it when it\'s guessing wrong? It keeps guessing
wrong.

So I started doing something simple: \*\*I started coaching the
conversation in real-time.\*\*

**Here\'s What That Actually Looks Like**

**Before:**

Me: \"I\'m thinking about career transitions\...\"

AI: \"Here\'s a 6-step plan for changing careers!\"

**After:**

Me: \"I\'m thinking about career transitions\...\"

AI: \"Here\'s a 6-step plan for---\"

Me: \"Stop. I\'m not ready for steps. I\'m still figuring out what I
actually want. Let\'s explore that first.\"

AI: \"Got it. What\'s pulling you toward change? And what\'s making you
hesitate?\"

See the difference?

**The Three Things I Started Doing**

**1. I interrupted when it went off-track**

The moment the AI started answering a question I didn\'t ask, I\'d
gently redirect:

\- \"You\'re giving me structure. I need exploration.\"

\- \"You\'re being formal. Talk to me like a friend.\"

\- \"You\'re listing options. Help me think through what matters.\"

**2. I made it check its own understanding**

Instead of just accepting whatever it said, I\'d ask:

\- \"What do you think I\'m really trying to figure out here?\"

\- \"Read back what I just said. What\'s the actual question?\"

This simple move forced it to actually listen instead of just
pattern-match.

**3. I treated it like a conversation, not a search bar**

I stopped typing one question and waiting for one answer.

I started having actual back-and-forth:

\- Asking a question

\- Correcting its assumptions

\- Building on good responses

\- Circling back to earlier points

\- Sometimes even talking about how the conversation itself was going

**What Happened**

The AI got\... better?

Not because the technology changed. Because **I** changed how I was
using it.

It started:

\- Asking clarifying questions before jumping to answers

\- Matching my tone and energy

\- Remembering what I cared about

\- Catching its own misunderstandings

**Then I Realized Something About AI Governance**

This whole experience revealed why most AI governance initiatives fail.

Organizations spend months creating policy documents:

\- Don\'t share confidential information

\- Don\'t use AI for decision-making in X contexts

\- Don\'t upload customer data

\- Review all AI outputs before using them

**But they never teach people HOW to actually collaborate with AI.**

The result? One of two things happens:

1\. **Nobody uses the AI** because they\'re afraid of breaking the rules

2\. **Shadow AI flourishes** -- people use the tools anyway to get work
done, but they hide it to avoid compliance friction, creating unseen
risk and unaudited outputs.

**The skills I developed through trial and error---the ability to:**

· Detect when AI is misinterpreting my intent

· Redirect the conversation in real-time

· Verify the AI understands what I\'m actually asking

· Build transparent audit trails from the natural conversation flow

· Correct drift before it compounds into wrong outputs

**These aren\'t \"power user tips.\" These are foundational governance
skills.**

And most organizations aren\'t teaching them.

**Why This Matters for Your Organization**

If your team has AI policies but people still aren\'t using AI
effectively (or are using it in ways you can\'t audit), the problem
isn\'t the policy.

**It\'s that you\'re teaching compliance without teaching
collaboration.**

Effective AI governance isn\'t just about restrictions. It\'s about
giving people the skills to:

**- Recognize when AI misunderstands the task** (Interpretive Drift
Detection)

**- Provide corrective feedback that actually works** (Real-time
Calibration)

\- **Verify outputs match intent** (Provenance Verification)

\- **Create audit trails of the interaction** (Governance Documentation)

These are the same frameworks I formalized in my governance
methodology---but they started with something as simple as learning to
have a better conversation.

**Try This Tomorrow**

Next time you\'re using AI at work and the response feels off, don\'t
just accept it or start over.

Pause and say one thing:

\"*I don\'t think we\'re on the same page. Here\'s what I\'m actually
trying to figure out\...\"*

Then watch what happens.

Notice what you had to clarify. Notice what assumptions the AI made.
Notice how you redirected it.

***That\'s governance in action**.*

**The Real Lesson**

Good AI governance isn\'t about asking the right questions upfront.

It\'s about noticing when you\'re being misunderstood and knowing how to
course-correct in the moment.

That\'s a teachable skill. But most organizations haven\'t realized they
need to teach it yet.

**What about you?**

Has your team deployed AI tools with clear policies, but adoption is
still lower than expected? Or are people using AI in ways you can\'t
track or audit?

Drop a comment. I\'m curious what governance gaps you\'re seeing in
practice.

\-\--

\*I help organizations move beyond AI policy documents to operational
governance frameworks---teaching teams the collaboration skills that
make AI both useful and auditable. If your governance approach feels
like it\'s creating compliance theater instead of practical adoption,
let\'s talk about what\'s missing.\*
