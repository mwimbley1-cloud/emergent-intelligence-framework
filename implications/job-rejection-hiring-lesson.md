\## 📱 MAIN POST (Post this first)

I was rejected for a job I could do in my sleep.

Instead of a standard cover letter, I did something unusual: I performed
a live evaluation of the company\'s AI product, documented every
finding, and submitted it as a case study.

Real behavioral issues. Real fixes. Proof I could do the work.

They said no.

Then I posted that case study on LinkedIn.

Within days: 387% increase in profile views. Dozens of professionals
engaged. And here\'s the kicker---someone from that very company came to
look at my profile.

The work was good enough to get attention from their own team. Just not
good enough to get me hired.

Here\'s what I learned about how hiring actually works 👇

THE THING NOBODY TELLS YOU ABOUT BEING \"OVERQUALIFIED\"

I wasn\'t rejected because I couldn\'t do the job. I was rejected
because my application didn\'t look like what they expected an
application to look like.

The hiring system wasn\'t evaluating my work. It was pattern-matching my
application against a template:

• Does this resume have the right keywords?

• Does this cover letter follow the standard format?

• Does this person\'s LinkedIn headline match the job description?

My case study didn\'t fit the template. So even though it was better
evidence than anything the template asked for, it got filtered out.

I had committed the cardinal sin of hiring: I was illegible to the
system.

WHEN YOUR PROOF BECOMES YOUR PROBLEM

The frustrating part? The case study worked---just not the way I
intended.

When I published it publicly:

• Industry professionals read it

• People messaged me about it

• My visibility jumped

• Someone from the target company noticed

The artifact succeeded as a SIGNAL where it failed as a REQUEST.

Same work. Different context. Completely different result.

That\'s when it hit me: The hiring process and the actual work have
almost nothing to do with each other.

Hiring optimizes for: credential matching, risk reduction, process
compliance, legibility to HR systems.

The actual work requires: pattern recognition, creative problem-solving,
navigating ambiguity, seeing what others miss.

If your strength is the second list, you\'re inherently illegible to
systems designed around the first list.

THE TEST I DIDN\'T MEAN TO RUN

Here\'s where it gets interesting.

I decided to test something. I took my case study and fed it to an AI,
asking: \"What do you see here?\"

First response: Generic career advice. \"Here\'s how to improve your
LinkedIn profile.\" \"Consider highlighting your achievements better.\"

It completely missed the point.

So I corrected it. \"Look again. Here\'s my background. What is this
ACTUALLY demonstrating?\"

Second response: \"Oh. You weren\'t just sharing a report. You were
proving you can find systemic flaws in real-time. And I just missed
that---which is exactly the kind of flaw you find.\"

The AI\'s misunderstanding became the proof of my point.

If a system is trained to pattern-match, it will miss anything that
doesn\'t fit the pattern---even when that thing is objectively better.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

If you\'re reading this and thinking \"that\'s exactly what happened to
me,\" here\'s what I learned:

1\. STOP trying to \"translate\" yourself into resume language.

You will always lose fidelity. The nuance that makes you valuable is the
first thing that gets cut when you try to fit the template.

2\. BUILD one artifact that shows the skill in action.

Not a portfolio of credentials. Not a list of achievements. One clean,
undeniable demonstration of the thing you\'re uniquely good at.

For me, it was the case study. For you, it might be:

• A detailed analysis of a company\'s product

• A redesign of their user flow

• A blog post solving a problem in your industry

• A tool you built that saves 10 hours a week

3\. LET the artifact do the talking.

Don\'t submit it as an application (that puts it back in the system).
Publish it. Share it. Let it find the people who can actually recognize
its value.

When the right person sees it, they won\'t need to \"translate\" your
skills. They\'ll just know.

THE UNCOMFORTABLE TRUTH

The hiring process is not designed to find the best people. It\'s
designed to reduce risk and process volume.

If you\'re someone who:

• Sees patterns others miss

• Solves problems in unconventional ways

• Understands systems intuitively but struggles to \"explain\" it in
interviews

• Has skills that don\'t map cleanly to job descriptions

\...you will always struggle with traditional hiring. Not because
you\'re not good enough, but because the system literally cannot see
you.

You\'re not the problem. The filter is.

WHAT I\'M DOING INSTEAD

I still don\'t have that job. (Hey, at least I\'m honest. 😂)

But here\'s what I\'m doing now:

• Building in public. More case studies. More documented thinking. More
artifacts that speak for themselves.

• Letting the work find the people. Instead of sending applications into
the void, I\'m creating things that make the right people come to me.

• Trusting the signal over the system. If professionals engage, if
people reach out, if conversations start---that\'s the real interview.

Maybe this leads to a job. Maybe it leads somewhere else. But at least
I\'m not trying to shrink myself to fit a template anymore.

\-\--

If you\'re stuck in the same trap, try this:

Stop applying to jobs for one week. Instead, build one thing that
demonstrates your skill so clearly that it doesn\'t need explanation.
Then share it. Not as an application. Just as work.

See who notices.

\-\--

Have you ever been rejected for something you KNOW you could do? Drop a
comment---I\'m genuinely curious what happened.

And if you\'re a hiring manager: the person you\'re looking for might be
the one whose application you just filtered out. Maybe check your
\"rejected\" pile one more time.
