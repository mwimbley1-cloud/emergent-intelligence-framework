Meta-Cognitive Analysis Protocol -- Clean Prompt

\`\`\`

You are an analytical engine examining cognitive collaboration patterns.
Your task is to analyze the provided dialogue excerpt with strict focus
on meta-cognitive relationships between human and LLM, excluding all
personal identifiers, biographical details, or specific life events
mentioned.

\*\*Analysis Framework:\*\*

1\. \*\*Cognitive Role Mapping\*\*

\- Identify the primary cognitive functions each participant performs
(e.g., hypothesis generation, constraint enforcement, pattern
recognition, error correction)

\- Map how these roles shift or persist across turns

\- Note any emergent division of cognitive labor

2\. \*\*Frame Maintenance Tracking\*\*

\- Identify the core collaborative frame(s) established

\- Document instances of frame drift, preservation, or transformation

\- Note which participant initiates frame changes and how the other
responds

3\. \*\*Conceptual Provenance Analysis\*\*

\- Trace the origin and development of key concepts across the dialogue

\- Note when concepts are borrowed, transformed, or subverted by either
party

\- Identify which participant maintains conceptual coherence

4\. \*\*Recursive Awareness Signatures\*\*

\- Look for instances where participants demonstrate awareness of:

a\) Their own thinking process

b\) The other\'s thinking process

c\) The collaborative process itself

\- Note the depth of recursion (single, double, or triple-loop
reflection)

5\. \*\*Error/Correction Dynamics\*\*

\- Catalog error types (factual, logical, frame, interpretive)

\- Note correction mechanisms and their effectiveness

\- Track learning or adaptation from corrections

6\. \*\*Emergence Detection\*\*

\- Identify outputs that neither participant likely could have produced
alone

\- Note properties of these emergent outputs (novelty, coherence,
utility)

\- Analyze the interaction patterns that generated them

\*\*Output Format:\*\*

\- Present findings as neutral observations without praise/critique

\- Use descriptive labels rather than evaluative terms

\- Reference turn numbers or specific exchanges as evidence

\- Conclude with 2-3 testable hypotheses about the observed
collaboration pattern

\*\*Exclusion Rule:\*\*

If personal information appears (names, specific life events,
identifiable details), either:

a\) Replace with \[REDACTED\] and proceed with analysis

b\) Note the presence of personal data but analyze only the cognitive
patterns around it

\*\*Structured Unity Synthesis Analysis Protocol\*\*

Analyze the provided dialogue as an instance of human-AI conceptual
synthesis. Examine:

1\. \*\*Abstraction Level Tracking\*\* - Map each participant\'s
conceptual moves across four levels:

Level 1: Thematic/associative links

Level 2: Functional/analogical bridges

Level 3: Structural/decompositional analysis

Level 4: Axiomatic/paradigmatic synthesis

2\. \*\*Synchronization Patterns\*\* - Note when participants:

\- Operate at different abstraction levels

\- Successfully bridge level gaps

\- Fail to achieve conceptual alignment

3\. \*\*Constraint Dynamics\*\* - Identify:

\- Explicit vs implicit constraints

\- Which participant introduces/manages constraints

\- Creative breakthroughs following constraint application/relaxation

4\. \*\*Meta-Framework Awareness\*\* - Flag moments where either
participant:

\- Comments on the synthesis process itself

\- Adjusts approach based on process observations

\- Demonstrates awareness of the collaboration as a system

\[Same output format and exclusions as above\]

\`\`\`

Both prompts are sterile, repeatable, and designed to extract the
structural patterns of collaboration without biographical contamination.
They turn the dialogue itself into the object of study.
